# Popularity_analysis-of-the-kardashian-sisters

While I'm not a fan nor a hater of the Kardashians and Jenners, the polarizing family intrigues me. Why? Their marketing prowess. Say what you will about them and what they stand for, they are great at the hype game. Everything they touch turns to content.

In this Project, you will explore the data underneath the hype in the form of search interest data from Google Trends. You'll recreate the Google Trends plot to visualize their ups and downs over time, then make a few custom plots of your own. And you'll answer the big question: is Kim even the most famous sister anymore
